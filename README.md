The project’s primary challenge was handling the input and output formats, specifically parsing BLIF and PLA files. Each format has unique structures: BLIF files define inputs and outputs explicitly and use truth tables to describe logic, while PLA files list input-output pairs, often including don’t-care conditions (-). To manage these formats, a robust parsing function was developed to identify the format and extract minterms and outputs accordingly. Handling don’t-care terms required a heuristic approach that expanded them into all possible binary combinations, enabling comprehensive processing in subsequent steps.

The Boolean minimization process was abstracted into modular subproblems. These included parsing, grouping minterms by the number of 1s, combining terms differing by one bit, and identifying prime implicants. Each module tackled a specific task, ensuring the solution was scalable and manageable. For example, grouping minterms was repetitive but necessary to simplify logic iteratively. The Quine-McCluskey algorithm, used for simplification, relies on repetitive pairwise comparisons of terms. Efficient marking of combined terms prevented redundant checks and ensured accurate identification of prime implicants.

Breaking down the problem into subproblems enabled a divide-and-conquer approach, making the complex task of Boolean minimization more manageable. This modular design also facilitated easier debugging and testing since each component could be validated independently before integration. Overall, the solution efficiently handled inputs, simplified Boolean expressions, and generated outputs in both formats, ensuring flexibility and correctness across different use cases.
